# Prerequisites

This image assumes that you are using a reverse proxy such as [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) and optionally the [Let's Encrypt Proxy Companion @ https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) in order to serve your pages. However, it will run just fine on it's own if you map appropriate ports.



# Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Registry](https://hub.docker.com/tiredofit/nginx-php-fpm) and is the recommended method of installation.


```bash
docker pull hub.docker.com/tiredofit/nginx-php-fpm:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available:

* `5.3-latest` - PHP 5.3.29 w/Alpine 3.4
* `5.5-latest` - PHP 5.5..38 w/Alpine 3.4
* `5.6-latest` - PHP 5.6.x w/Alpine 3.5
* `7.0-latest` - PHP 7.0.x w/Alpine 3.5
* `7.1-latest` - PHP 7.1.x w/Alpine 3.6
* `7.1-ldap-latest` - PHP 7.1.x w/LDAP Authentication w/Alpine 3.6
* `latest` - Most recent release of PHP w/most recent Alpine Linux

# Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

# Configuration

### Data-Volumes

The container starts up and reads from `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` for some basic configuration and to listen on port 73 internally for Nginx Status responses. `/etc/nginx/conf.d` contains a sample configuration file that can be used to customize a nginx server block. 

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/www/html` | Root Directory |
| `/www/logs` | Nginx and php-fpm logfiles |

### Database

No Database Required - MariaDB Client is located within the image.

### Environment Variables

Along with the Environment Variables from the Base image, below is the complete list of available options 
that can be used to customize your installation.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT` |Amount of memory php-fpm process should use (Default `128M`) |
| `PHP_LOG_LEVEL` | Define verbosity: (e.g `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`, and `alert` - Default `info`)
| `PHP_TIMEOUT`   | Sets Read and Write Timeouts for Nginx FastCGI (Default `300`) |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE` | Maximum Upload Size: (Default `2G`) |
| `APC_SHM_SIZE` | PHP7 APC SHM Cache Size: (Default `128M`) |
| `OPCACHE_MEM_SIZE` | PHP7 OPCache Size - Select `0` to Disable (Default `128`) |
| `TZ` | Timezone - Use Unix Timezone format (Default `America/Vancouver`) |

### Networking

The following ports are exposed.

| Port      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `80` 		| HTTP 		  |

# Maintenance
#### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. 

```bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is e.g. nginx-php-fpm) bash
```
